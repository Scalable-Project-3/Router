resource message: "resource,sender_name,resource_name,val"
only the 'val' will be encrypted

authentication part (security center):
    generate key pair (e-key, d-key)
    dispatch e-key to producer and d-key to consumer respectively once requested


consumer part:
    first request d-key(encrypted by consumer's public key) from authentication.py
    use its own private key to decrypt the d-key -> get the d-key
    use the d-key(similar to private key) to decrypt ase key(encrypted by e-key(similar to pub key))
    -> get the ase key
    use the ase key to decrypt the resource(val) -> get the resource(val)


producer part:
    register in the authentication using certificate(pub_key of authentication) to encrypt own ase key then send it to authentication
    first request e-key from authentication.py
    using e-key to encrypt the ase key
    send out the encrypted ase key + encrypted resource(val)
